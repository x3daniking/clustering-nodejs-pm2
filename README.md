# clustering-nodejs-pm2
nodejs clustering test app with pm2 and loadtest...

in this app, initially we create worker threads manually and test it using loadtest and manually. test the efficiency of clustering in node js and how it's helpful when cpu intensive tasks and present. How clustering is not effective when the data is fairly small or the process is not cpu intensive.

then we use pm2 to create and manage the processes.
